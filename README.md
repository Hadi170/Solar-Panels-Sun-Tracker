# ðŸŒž Solar Panels Sun Tracker

An Arduino + ESP32 project that automatically tracks the sun using Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) and servo motors to maximize solar energy capture.  
This project was developed as part of my robotics/electronics coursework.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Solar panels produce the most energy when directly facing the sun.  
This tracker uses **4 LDR sensors** to detect sunlight intensity and automatically adjusts the solar panel position with **2 servo motors** (horizontal & vertical movement).

Later, the system was expanded with:
- **ESP32 microcontroller** for Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **Voltage & Current sensors** for power monitoring.
- **DHT22 sensor** for temperature & humidity readings.
- **Blynk IoT app integration** to remotely monitor values and control motors manually.

---

## âš¡ Features
- Dual-axis sun tracking (horizontal & vertical).
- Real-time solar data (voltage, current, temperature, humidity).
- Mobile app dashboard via **Blynk IoT**.
- Manual override of servo motors from smartphone.
- Arduino Uno version (basic) and ESP32 version (IoT-enabled).

## ðŸ›  Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno & ESP32 boards
- 4 Ã— LDR sensors
- 2 Ã— Servo motors
- DHT22 temperature & humidity sensor
- Voltage sensor 
- Current sensor 
- Solar panel

**Note: Don't forget to follow the specific pins for each sensor inside the code, otherwise you will have to make your own changes.**
